Teesra Ayaam is basically a Java Script web app used to convert 2-D images to 3-d images. Here, we are basically using Bing Image scarping,
where you can search anytype of image on the search bar. And you will get the images results from Bing search engine. Then on Clicking on the
"Convert to third dimension", you can get a 3-d image of it. 
It is under developement phase, you may feel free to contribute through any means you want.
